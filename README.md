## Abstract
The project applies multiple statistical and machine learning models to Amazon’s quarterly revenue data, including ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), Holt-Winters Seasonal Model, and others. By analyzing trends and seasonality, it provides a framework for forecasting future revenue and addresses challenges such as non-stationary data, missing values, and parameter tuning. The Exponential Average model emerged as the most effective forecasting method, achieving the lowest RMSE.

## Motivation
Time-series forecasting is crucial for financial planning and decision-making. This study leverages Amazon’s revenue data to:
- Analyze financial time-series data dynamics.
- Address challenges like seasonality, trends, and irregularities.
- Develop a robust forecasting framework adaptable to other business scenarios.

## Challenges
The project tackled several key challenges:
1. **Seasonality and Trends**: Modeling seasonal patterns such as holiday sales and promotional campaigns.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling anomalies, missing values, and ensuring stationarity using differencing, decomposition, and transformations.
3. **Model Selection**: Comparing models with varying assumptions and complexities.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Using RMSE, MAPE, and AIC to assess model performance.
5. **Balancing Complexity and Accuracy**: Striving for accurate predictions without overfitting.

## Methodology
The project followed a structured approach:
1. **Data Collection**: Historical quarterly revenue data from 2006-2020.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, stationarizing, and decomposing data into components (trend, seasonality, residuals).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing patterns, trends, and seasonal effects.
4. **Model Implementation**: Applying ARIMA, SARIMA, EWMA, Holt-Winters, and Exponential Average models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Comparing models using metrics like RMSE and selecting the best-fit model.
6. **Forecasting**: Using the best-performing model to predict future revenue.

### Tools and Techniques
- **Algorithms**: ARIMA, SARIMA, EWMA, Holt-Winters, and others.
- **Preprocessing**: Differencing, decomposition, log transformation.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAPE, AIC.
- **Visualization**: Time plots, autocorrelation plots, and decomposition plots.

## Key Results
1. **Best Model**: The Exponential Average (EA) model achieved the lowest RMSE, indicating the highest accuracy.
2. **Comparison**:
   - ARIMA: Effective for trends and noise but struggled with strong seasonality.
   - EWMA: Captured short-term trends but less effective for long-term patterns.
   - Holt-Winters: Poor performance due to challenges in parameter tuning.
3. **Insights**: Advanced models like SARIMA demonstrated strong potential for seasonal forecasting.

## Future Work
1. **Integrate Machine Learning**: Use models like LSTM and Prophet to capture complex, non-linear patterns.
2. **Incorporate Exogenous Variables**: Add factors such as economic indicators, holidays, and market trends.
3. **Automate Workflows**: Utilize AutoML frameworks for data preprocessing and model selection.
4. **Real-Time Forecasting**: Deploy dynamic dashboards for continuous insights.
